          years into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a>, web pages have gotten big. Really big.
          According to the <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/page-weight">HTTP Archive's 2022 State of the Web Report</a>, as of May
          2022 the median page size was 2.2 MB, up from 669 KB in 2012. Contrast with 2002, when
          <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april03/lavoie/04lavoie.html">Trends in the Evolution of the Public Web</a> by O'Neill et al reported
          average web-page sizes between 10-20 KB. Much of this growth can be attributed to the rise of multimedia (web-pages in the 90's were
          predominantly text, and web connections were still slow-enough in the) early 2000's that video cost a significant amount of bandwidth. High speed
          internet connections are very prevalant nowadays, so bandwidth is much less of a concern than it was in the day of 56k modems.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the bloat of the web, it's also a lot easier nowadays to create a webpage that looks good. 
          Tools like Flask, Django, and Jekyll make it simple to dynamically render web pages, and have plugins to make things as fast as possible to get up and running. React and Redux allow for complex websites that remain performant. Despite all the
          benefits of using a framework (GitHub Pages will even run Jekyll), I wanted the challenge of learning to make a site from scratch using only HTML, CSS,
          and JS. I hope you enjoy it!

        <p>Some fun facts about this website:
            <ul>
                <li>The first iteration of this site (way back in 2020) did actually use Jekyll!</li>
                <li>The header, footer, and navbar get included dynamically with JavaScript. This function could easily be expanded into a simple includes system if needed.</li>
                <li>The average page size on this website is ~120 KB, although 73 KB of this is the background image</li>
                <li>The background image was hand painted by me! I wanted something that looked like a crystal, with wires holding the atoms together.</li>
            </ul>
