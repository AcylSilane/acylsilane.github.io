          Hello! I'm best-described as a computational chemist specializing in data science and software development. There's some more detail in my
          <a href="/site/resume.html">resume</a>, if you want to answer the question of "<span title="ðŸŽµLetting the days go byðŸŽ¶"
            >Well, how did I get there?</span
          >"
        </p>

        <p>
          I like making things - doesn't matter if it's software, 3D modeling, composing music, or coming up with an experiment to test something.
          Science is my other passion! Whether it's being the first to publish on something, or just improving on what's already known, it's
          incredibly rewarding to check on an old publication and find other people have cited it. Even if they're just outlining other literature in
          their paper's intro, it's great to know that you've had some impact on another person's research. Chemistry is my main field, generally
          focusing on the application of machine learning to predict chemical properties. Despite seeming like a very specific and niche subfield,
          machine learning in chemistry has a ton of depth, ranging from representing molecules to a computer, databases, automation, the machine
          learning itself, optimization routines, etc. I'm not going to run out of things to learn any time soon, at least!
        </p>

        <p>
          Programming is definitely another big interest of mine. Most of my grad research involved computational chemistry calculations on a Unix
          supercomputer - at first, I started scripting away the repetitive parts in Python and Bash, but quickly realized how aesthetically-pleasing
          well-written, organized code can be in addition to the huge increase in productivity from being able to automate things. Python is
          definitely my main language, but I've also written C code, mostly for when Python is slower than I'd like.
        </p>

        <p>
          When not doing R&D or software development, I can usually be found in VR, or having fun with a flight simulator, or - more frequently -
          both! In terms of which sim, usually it's either DCS:F-14B or MS Flight Simulator 2020. Music and art are also incredibly fun! Guitar is the
          instrument I know best, but I also occasionally compose my own tracks in LMMS or FL Studio. Blender is my workhorse when it comes to 3D
          objects, and Substance Painter / Substance Designer is a great tool to generate textures. Sometimes I get into hand-drawn art - like the
          background of this site! That was painted in Krita.

          Thanks for taking an interest in learning some more about the person behind this site. If you're here looking for conversation material
          before meeting me, I hope this provided you with some ice-breakers!
